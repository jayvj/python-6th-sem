This very important Krishna consciousness movement is meant to save human
society from spiritual death. At present human society is being misled by leaders who
are blind, for they do not know the aim and objective of human life, which is self-
realization and the reestablishment of our lost relationship with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. That is the missing point. The Krishna consciousness movement is trying
to enlighten human society in this important matter.
According to Vedic civilization, the perfection of life is to realize one's relationship
with Krishna, or God. In the Bhagavad-gita, which is accepted by all authorities in
transcendental science as the basis of all Vedic knowledge, we understand that not only
human beings but all living entities are parts and parcels of God. The parts are meant
for serving the whole, just as the legs, hands, fingers, and ears are meant for serving
the total body. We living entities, being parts and parcels of God, are duty-bound to
serve Him.
